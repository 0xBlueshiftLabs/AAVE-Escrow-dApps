# ChainShot-AAVE-Escrows

Smart contract solutions to the problems posed by ChainShot's AAVE Escrow course.

Smart contract, ‘Vanilla Escrow’, facilitates a simple escrow service whereby, once funds have been deposited to the smart contract, only the arbiter can approve the withdrawal of said funds.

Building upon this, smart contracts AAVE Eth Escrow and AAVE Dai Escrow, allow the depositor to earn interest whilst the funds are in escrow, through utilisation of AAVE’s lending pools. Once approved by the arbiter, the beneficiary receives the initial amount deposited to the smart contract, whilst any interest earned is sent to the depositor.
